<a name="l-3"></a><span class="tm">02:00:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lightningbot&gt;</span> Useful Commands: #action #agreed #help #info #idea #link #topic.
<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">02:01:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> hey all, might be an abbreviated session this time
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">02:05:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> hi
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">02:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanquake&gt;</span> hi
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">02:09:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> did we run out of topics for this week or am i disconnected
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">02:09:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> doesn't seem like anyone's got any questions
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">02:10:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fanquake&gt;</span> instagibbs I'm not seeing any chatter either
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">02:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> were they any lingering disccusions from last QA? I missed t
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">02:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> there was a fair bit of discussion about upgrade stuff -- OP_SUCCESS and annex things
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">02:16:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> there's also a few suggestions/PRs along the lines of improving motivation/rationale
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">02:17:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> i found the rationale helped a lot with disambiguating the meaning of the text, especially successx section
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">02:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> might mean a slight cleanup warranted
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">02:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> yeah, PRs welcome :)
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">02:21:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> the only thing bothering me really is the definition of codeseparator_position, if we get 4GB+ blocks it is undefined what happens when the marked position is beyond 2^32 :P
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">02:22:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> now that scripts are unbounded in size, only implicitly bounded by blockweight
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">02:22:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> we already bumped that from 16 bits when the 10k script length limit got dropped
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">02:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> anyway, big blocks would be a hard fork, so if we made it more of a hard fork we could add another spend_type bit to allow for encoding the codesep pos via compactsize (if 64bit numbers are enough for you) or similar
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">02:28:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> or we could reintroduce a script size limit that's more than 4M but less than 4G
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">02:31:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> yes was not a particularly pressing/serious concern
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">02:32:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> any more progress with the multisig tree jupyter notebook?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">02:33:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> no sorry :) it works, dies a combinatoric death at 21-of-30
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">02:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> vast majority of the computation is computing the musig pubkeys, someone noted that the tweak could just be the superset of all n signers, might bring down the computation
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">02:38:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> any thoughts on whether it makes more sense to stay below ~30 signers, or go unaccountable with threshold-musig, or use checksigadd or similar script?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">02:39:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> ah, i see there's a magazine article where samson mow talks about having "hundreds" of functionaries
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">02:41:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> there's a scheme for quasi-accountability, but I'd have to defer to andytoshi for that
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">02:42:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> i guess if you have that many, one approach might be to group them into sets of 5 and allow unaccountable 4/5 musig between them, and do checksigadd to require 18/20 groups to sign or similar for between 72 and 92 of 100 multisig
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">02:43:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> there's a scheme where the honest participants in the multisig can track who the other co-signers were, so long as you have some honest participants
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">02:44:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;instagibbs&gt;</span> anyways, that's Future Work with threshold
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">02:46:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aj&gt;</span> okay, about time for me to put the laptop away, so i guess we'll call it
