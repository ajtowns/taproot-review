# Week Seven Info

You know, finding quotes has been more or less the hardest part of writing these things, so in the spirit of Lightning's [BOLT-0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/00-introduction.md#theme-song) here's a song parody instead (with apologies to [Sandi Thom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2jDz6w-r4)):

> [chorus]  
> *Oh I wish I was a cypherpunk with miners in my lair  
> In '96 and 2k9, revolution was in the air  
> I was born too late, into a world that doesn't care,  
> Oh I wish I was a cypherpunk with miners in my lair.*
>
> When the head of state didn't tweet out memes, and everything was as it seemed,  
> When crypto meant cryptography and RSA was king.  
> When regulators didn't know what's what, and ICOs were just a thought,  
> And the darknet was still scary, and would sell you anything.
>
> [chorus]
>
> Satoshi was more than a myth, and coderpunks was still a list,  
> Your identity was yours to keep and not just up for sale.  
> When Pretty Good was the best we'd see, and information yearned to be free,  
> And illegal weapons export meant a t-shirt in the mail.
>
> [chorus]
>
> When manifestos were still cool, and governments were run by fools,  
> And the greatest walls were stone and bricks just lying in the dirt.  
> Hackers were lovable scamps, and everybody hated banks,  
> And Extropians still had long hair and dreamed they'd save the world.
>
> [chorus, half-chorus]

As mentioned last week, we've hopefully already covered all the content for all three BIP drafts now, so it's just wrap up left!

There's a [Taproot Review Conclusions](https://forms.gle/8ZB19FAj7mfZJV6t8) form up to collect summary conclusions. You can fill it in anonymously if you'd like; but the theory is we'll write up a short wiki page to summarise the results so if you're happy to include your name (and affiliation) you can do so.

Pieter Wuille is giving a presentation at SF Bitcoin Devs on [an overview of the changes in bip-taproot and bip-tapscript](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Bitcoin-Devs/events/267096575/), which may be of interest -- it's only 10 hours away as I'm writing this though, so may already be over by the time you're reading this...

To repeat the comment from last week, as we're wrapping up this review, you might want to consider your overall assessment of the drafts:

 * Were there any parts that I'm not familiar enough with?
 * Were there any problems that haven't been filed as an issue,
   don't have a patch prepared, or have gotten stuck in discussion?
 * Are there any easy/big improvements that should get added in?
 * Am I comfortable with the set of changes being proposed -- conceivably there could be too many changes and some of them should be split out; or perhaps there are too few changes and others should be merged in?
 * Do I think this is ready to be assigned a BIP number and move onto code review and eventual deployment?

This week's Q&A is the last one planned, so it's a good time to ask any questions that have been left hanging. It's also a good time to talk about any good ideas people might have for helping the next stage go smoothly, if and when we're ready to move onto it.

## Miscellaneous

The IRC channel for the Q&A sessions is ##taproot-bip-review on the Freenode IRC network. If you've got questions through the week, feel free to ask there -- if someone is around and available they might be able to answer. As well as the [meeting logs](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/taproot-bip-review/2019/) there are ongoing [channel logs](http://www.erisian.com.au/taproot-bip-review/) as well, in case you want to see what's been going on there while you've been absent. There's only one scheduled Q&A session this week: Tue 1900 UTC (America/Europe/Africa), but feel free to ask questions at any time during the week.

 * Tue 17 Dec 11:00 -0800 Los Angeles
 * Tue 17 Dec 14:00 -0500 New York
